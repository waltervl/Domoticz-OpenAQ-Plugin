# OpenAQ
This Domoticz plugin gets the air quality at your location from https://openaq.org. This plugin is also one of the software projects as shown on https://openaq.org/#/community/projects?type=Software.
OpenAQ is collecting data in 64 different countries and always seeking to add more. They aggregate PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), and black carbon (BC) from real-time government and research grade sources.
The plugin scans the stations nearby your location and takes the data about all the pollutants which are closest to your location.

With special recognition to user Xorfor for creating this plugin.
from v3.1: An OpenAQ API KEY is needed that you can obtain from https://explore.openaq.org/account
